# FuelConsumptionCalculator
This is an Android app to calculate your car's fuel consumption after refueling. I was requested to make this by someone who doesn't speak english very well, so most of it is german. Furthermore they aren't "tech savvy", which means I had to explain a bit more than usual on the app's main screen.

As said above this app is to calculate fuel consumption, not much else. 

This is a project intended for private use by some selected persons. It has not been optimized to be used by other people. 

## Requirements and setup
* Java 7 or higher
* Android 8.0 Oreo or higher
* Replace mipmap-hdpi/nyd.jpg and nyd_resize.jpg with pictures that you'd like to see on the app's home screen

## Usage

## Known Problems
Clicking on an entry in the list of refueling data will only show raw data. There is no UI for that yet.

## Future Plans 
Building the UI for displaying the data of a refueling entry, when clicked on in the list
